# sjwarner's dotfiles

In this repo, I store my dotfiles. While mainly this is due to my paranoia of some catastrophic failure of my laptop, anyone that is interested are free to use them!

This is taken from my laptop. At the moment, all of my `bash` stuff is stored in `.bash_profile` instead of being nicely seperated out in to multiple files.

My `.vimrc` is incomplete, but I am still figuring out exactly how I like it configured. At the moment it is a range of settings that suit my workflow, but no plugins etc. yet!
