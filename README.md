# sjwarner's dotfiles

In this repo, I store my dotfiles. While mainly this is due to my paranoia of some catastrophic failure of my laptop, anyone that is interested are free to use them!

This is taken from my laptop. At the moment, all of my `bash` stuff is stored in `.bash_profile` instead of being nicely seperated out in to multiple files.

In future, I will look to add `.vimrc` and other dotfiles, though I feel they need refining first!
